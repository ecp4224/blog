title: Anime and Animu
---

[Animu](https://github.com/hypereddie/Animu) is a simple project I started last year when I was fed up with how limited Windows Explorer was when it came to
customization. I didn't like how folders looked and I didn't like how Windows refused to make thumbnails for my
MKV files...so I made Animu.

#What was the goal?

I wanted Animu to be simple, sexy, and easy to use. I wanted it to provide me information that Windows Explorer could
never provide me, and I wanted Animu to work out of the box. 

#Did it work..?

I believe (in my opinion at least), that I achieved the sexy part of this goal.

Animu works with VLC, MPC HC, and Windows Media Player out of the box, however, it also supports any player with
custom command line arguments. 

Animu also hooks into [MyAnimeList](http://myanimelist.net) to retrieve info (such as genres,
user score, description ect..) and cover photos for each anime.

And lastly, Animu is automatic, so any anime I add to my collection will automaticlly be added to Animu without me having
to do anything.

So all in all, I think Animu was quite a successful project..

#But you can't have success without failure

Animu's short comings was actually the most important part of it, importing anime. It's not easy figuring out the Anime
title given a single folder name and several files. A lot of uncertainty comes into play; the folder name may not be the
actual name of the Anime, the names of the files/folder may have extra information that we're not interested in (such
as the resolution or audio quality), and what if the folder name is a nickname for the anime or it's spelt wrong..?

Animu does it's best to parse out random, unneeded information from the folder name and file names, and [MyAnimeList's](http://myanimelist.net)
search API really helps out when it comes to searching English names, but Animu will still fail to parse sometimes..

However, this is where it's important to make anime settings easily accessible. Right-clicking any anime will bring up
the settings pane, where you can change the MyAnimeList data, the Anime's title, and remove the anime all together.

These settings solve the problems Animu may produce when importing anime, and while it's not the most elegant solution..
it's sometimes best to let the user manually fix it. User knows best after all!



In conclusion, I'm enjoying this project, and I'm even thinking about [adding some sort of recommendation system](https://github.com/cloudera/oryx),
but I still need to have users test it and release 1.0...
